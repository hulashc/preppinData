Week 2 - We can drag the dataset on to other to either replace, union or join. We did union.
When we union, the tables are stacked on top of each other. Good if their are similar field structure.
We can convert the date structure into other date structures, in More options, Convert Date.
We converted to Yearly quarters - 1,2,3,4.
For median, min, max - we use aggregation step. We create three agregation steps separately.
We aggregated with Max/Median/Min price per Quarter, flow card?, class
We then pivot the table selecting rows to columns option. because we need class as columns.
After doing these separately for all three aggregation we have to make a union. Don't forget to rename the columns.
We see a discreprency in the classes. We sort it out be renaming and making a output.
