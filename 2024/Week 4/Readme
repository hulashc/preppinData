Week 4 - We input the .xlsx data into prep builder and drag the flow card worksheet to the flow. Then we need to combine only the data where there is information about the flow card. Go to  "Tables" options and click on worksheet filters to add a wildcard with "Card" between * >Apply.
Make the calculated field to find out the "Flow card?" with the below calculation.
IF CONTAINS([Table Names],'Non') THEN 'Non-Flow Card'
ELSE 'Flow Card'
END
Then we group by seat, row, class, flow card? and aggregate by Sum of Number of Rows(Aggregate).
This helps to know how frequently a particular **seat-row-class-flow card** combination appears. It can be used to detect patterns or inconsistencies (e.g., if certain seats are always classified as "Flow card").
It may assist in **capacity planning**, **trend analysis**, or **optimization of seating arrangements**.
Then we union the data with the seat plan, only to keep the seats that are not booked.
We get a final table where there are only seats that are not booked.
